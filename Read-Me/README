# React-Coding-Assessment

I completed this coding assessment as a practical job application to a position within Activision.

I had no prior experience with React, React Native, and limited experience with JavaScript before I was reached out to for this opportunity.

The task I was given was to replicate the functionality and look of a login page for a mobile app that had been released for a Call of Duty game. Within a week and some change, I completed courses on Codecademy for JavaScript, React, and React Native. It then took me another couple days to complete the task and submit the assessment, totaling about 2 weeks total time spent. I submitted the assessment, and followed up with the staff member I was in communication with. I recieved no further communication from Activision on the matter.
